                You had Zest’s COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test today developed by an
                authorized Zest Medco tester listed above. This test enables a rapid
                diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19, Coronavirus) infection. This test has
                been authorized by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)
                for use by authorized CLIA Waived licensed businesses. This technology
                boasts one of the highest sensitivities (likelihood that a negative test is truly
                negative) currently available on the market. If you have any questions or
                concerns regarding Zest’s technology, please visit our website at
                <a href="https://www.zest.com/">zest.com</a>.
